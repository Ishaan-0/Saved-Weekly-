## Challenges Faced
Discover Weekly Not Appearing in User Playlists
Initially, the project attempted to retrieve the Discover Weekly playlist by listing all user playlists using the sp.current_user_playlists() function. However, the Discover Weekly playlist did not show up in the results. This was a significant hurdle because the Discover Weekly playlist is dynamically generated by Spotify and may not be explicitly listed as one of the user's playlists.

Solution: Using the Search Function
To resolve this, we decided to use the sp.search() function to search for the Discover Weekly playlist by name. This method reliably returns the Discover Weekly playlist even when it does not appear in the user's playlists.

This approach ensured that the Discover Weekly playlist could be found and its songs retrieved, allowing us to proceed with saving them to the "Saved Weekly" playlist.

## Usage
Log in to Spotify: You will be redirected to the Spotify login page to authorize the application.
Save Discover Weekly Songs: The app will automatically retrieve songs from your Discover Weekly playlist and save them to a custom playlist named "Saved Weekly".
